# RaspberryPi-IO-Project
Starting to Play with IO on the Raspberry Pi WORK IN PROGRESS
Intending to use the pi-gpio javascript library

Basing the App on Node.js and I am including all the dependencies (like boostrap, JQuery etc) locally as the pi will not necessarily have internet access when I am using the "website" to control the Pi's IO.

go to here:
https://www.npmjs.com/package/pi-gpio
to get the GPIO JS Library


good source for how to use it:
